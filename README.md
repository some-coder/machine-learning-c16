# Prediction of Survival of Heart Failure Patients

This is the machine learning project of group C16 (Arno, Ludi, Winward,
and Niels).

In our project, we try to **predict the survival of patients with
heart failure conditions** after a follow-up period using multiple machine
learning methods.

## Install the Required Dependencies

For this project, use Python 3. Python 2 will not work.

Install the Python 3 packages listed in the following table. Use the
`requirements.txt` to install packages easily using `pip`. Instead, you
can download packages manually. All dependencies are required, not
optional.

| Package | Version |
| --: | --: |
| `matplotlib` | 3.3.2 |
| `numpy` | 1.19.1 |
| `pandas` | 1.1.0 |
| `scikit-learn` | 0.23.2 |
| `statsmodels` | 0.12.1 |
| `graphviz` | 0.16 |
