# Prediction of Survival of Heart Failure Patients

This is the machine learning project of group C16 (Arno, Ludi, Winward,
and Niels).

In our project, we try to **predict the survival of patients with
heart failure conditions** after a follow-up period using machine
learning methods.

## Ensure You can Run this Project

This project requires Python 3 or later.
