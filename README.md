# Prediction of Survival of Heart Failure Patients

This is the machine learning project of group C16 (Arno, Ludi, Winward,
and Niels).

In our project, we try to **predict the survival of patients with
heart failure conditions** after a follow-up period using machine
learning methods.

## Ensure You can Run this Project

This project requires Python 3 or later. Python 2 will _not_ work!

The following Python 3 packages need to be installed. Versions slightly newer
or older may work as well.

| Package | Version |
| --: | --: |
| `matplotlib` | 3.3.2 |
| `numpy` | 1.19.1 |
| `pandas` | 1.1.0 |
| `scikit-learn` | 0.23.2 |

## Obtain the Dataset 

The dataset we use is accessible at
<a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+failure+clinical+records">the
University of California Machine Learning Repository (UCI-MLR)</a>.
